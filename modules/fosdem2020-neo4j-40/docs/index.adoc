== Availability

- New release 4.0 since Jan 15
- Big release with a lot of new features
- New major version with breaking changes
- Migration tools

== Features

- Multi-Database
- Security
- Fabric


[.section-title.green]
== Multi-Database

== Multi-Database Overview

- Ability to run multiple databases in a single dbms
- Default db, system database
- DSL to manage databases

== Multi-Database Example


[source.center,cypher]
----
:use system

CREATE DATABASE fosdem;

:use fosdem

// START/STOP/DROP DATABASE fosdem;
----


[.section-title.purple]
== Security

== Security Overview

* Fine grained security
* Stored in system database
* Users, roles
  ** Default: reader, writer, architect, editor
* Privileges - read, write, traverse, access!
* Managed via administration commands


== User Management

[source.center,cypher]
----
include::../fosdem-demo.cypher[tag=users]
----

== Privilege Management

* `ACCESS` - access for specific dbs
* `TRAVERSE` - entity traversal for specific dbs / types
* `READ` - property reads for specific dbs / types / property types
* `MATCH` - shorthand for TRAVERSE + READ 

* Others: Write, token, indexes, constraints, start and stop databases

== Privilege Management Example

[.section-title.green]
== Fabric

== Fabric Overview

- Proxying neo4j databases
- Single cypher query distributed across databases
- Allows
  ** sharding
  ** federation
  ** distributed processing
  
- Database selection in query

Tobias & Petr will talk about it in detail (17:30)

[.section-title.gold]
== Cypher Features

== Existential Subqueries

[source,cypher]

- `CYPHER runtime=compiled`
- Legacy Manual Lucene Index

== Cypher Shell

- Parameter parameter
- `:source <file>` and `-file <file.cypher>`
- Multi-db support
- 

== Other

- Cluster: multi raft
- Multi-Leader
- Akka for Cluster state management
- `CYPHER runtime=pipelined`

== Availability

- Available via Neo4j Desktop 1.2.4

Being a declarative language, Cypher focuses on the clarity of expressing *what* to retrieve from a graph, not on *how* to retrieve it.
You can think of Cypher as mapping English language sentence structure to patterns in a graph.

== Cypher syntax highlighting

Find all people who acted in the movie, The Matrix, returning the nodes and relationships found:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[rel:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'})
RETURN p, rel, m

* Declarative query language
* Focuses on _what_, not how to retrieve
* Uses keywords such as `MATCH`, `WHERE`, `CREATE`
* Runs in the database server for the graph
* ASCII art to represent nodes and relationships

== Quiz

[.statement]
Suppose you have a graph that contains _Customer_ and _Product_ nodes. A _Customer_ node can have a _BOUGHT_ relationship with a _Product_ node.
_Customer_ nodes can have other relationships with _Product_ nodes.
A _Customer_ node has a property named _customerName_.
A _Product_ node has a property named _productName_.
What Cypher query do you execute to return all of the products (by name) bought by customer 'ABCCO'.

Select the correct answer.

[none.answers]
- ◻️ [src-cypher]`MATCH (c:Customer {customerName: 'ABCCO'}) RETURN c.BOUGHT.productName`
- ◻️ [src-cypher]`MATCH (:Customer 'ABCCO')-[:BOUGHT]->(p:Product) RETURN p.productName`
- ◻️ [src-cypher]`MATCH (p:Product)<-[:BOUGHT_BY]-(:Customer 'ABCCO') RETURN p.productName`
- ◻️ [.fragment.check.ok]#✔️# [src-cypher]`MATCH (:Customer {customerName: 'ABCCO'})-[:BOUGHT]->(p:Product) RETURN p.productName`
